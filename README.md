#### Comment
Clean Code was a pleasure to read, and it had an enormous impact on my coding practices. Since I primarily work with Java, the book’s insights were particularly relevant and valuable. I believe this is a must-read for all new developers, as it provides essential principles for writing maintainable and efficient code.

### Effective Java (Joshua Bloch) <a name="effective-java"></a>
#### How did I enjoy my lecture ?
&starf; &starf; &starf; &star; &star;

#### What was the impact on my software engineer job ?
&starf; &starf; &starf; &starf; &star;

#### Comment
As someone who primarily codes in Java, Effective Java felt like the perfect book to deepen my understanding of the language. Overall, I found the reading engaging and gained valuable insights into writing better Java code. However, the sheer number of concepts made it difficult to fully grasp and retain everything in one read. I see it more as a reference book—something to keep close by while coding to quickly look up specific topics or best practices as needed.

## October 2023
### Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides) <a name="design-patterns"></a> 
#### How did I enjoy my lecture ?
&starf; &starf; &starf; &star; &star;

#### Did it have a big impact on my software engineer job ?
&starf; &starf; &starf; &starf; &star;

#### Comment
Design Patterns was a bit challenging to read in one go. I would recommend breaking it up into smaller sections, perhaps one chapter per week, to allow the principles to really sink in. That said, the explanations were clear, and the book provides timeless insights into reusable object-oriented design. It's definitely a book that developers should keep revisiting over time to reinforce and deepen their understanding of design patterns.

## November 2023
### Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (Martin Fowler) <a name="patterns-of-enterprise-application-architecture"></a> 
#### How did I enjoy my lecture ?
&starf; &starf; &star; &star; &star;

#### What was the impact on my software engineer job ?
&starf; &starf; &starf; &star; &star;

#### Comment
Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture might feel a bit dated for experienced developers, as many of the concepts it covers are now quite familiar. While it’s a valuable resource for newcomers to enterprise architecture, I personally didn’t gain that much new insight from it.

## December 2023
### Clean architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design (Robert C. Martin) <a name="clean-architecture"></a> 
#### How did I enjoy my lecture ?
&starf; &starf; &starf; &starf; &star;

#### What was the impact on my software engineer job ?
&starf; &starf; &starf; &starf; &starf;

#### Comment
Clean Architecture provides a clear and concise overview of key design and architectural patterns. It’s incredibly easy to read, and the principles presented are memorable and practical. This book does an excellent job of reinforcing core concepts, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking to improve the structure and maintainability of their software.

## April 2024
### Designing Data–Intensive Applications (Martin Kleppmanm) <a name="designing-data-intensive-applications"></a> 
#### How did I enjoy my lecture ?
&starf; &starf; &starf; &starf; &star;

#### What was the impact on my software engineer job ?
&starf; &starf; &starf; &starf; &starf;

#### Comment
Designing Data–Intensive Applications is a must-read for anyone looking to level up their software engineering career. While I found some parts of the book challenging, I learned a lot and was impressed by the wide range of topics it covers. From serialization—finally understanding how Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) work—to data replication, distributed systems, and more, it dives deep into the complexities behind designing data-intensive applications. This book gave me a much deeper understanding of data systems and their critical role in modern software development.

## June 2024
### Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems (Sam Newman) <a name="building-microservices"></a> 
#### How did I enjoy my lecture ?
&starf; &starf; &starf; &starf; &star;
